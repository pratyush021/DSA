# DSA 

This repository is where I practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and push new coding or DSA concepts that I learn.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for various DSA implementations and practice problems.
  - `datastructures/`: Custom implementations of data structures.
  - `neetcode150/stack/`: Solutions to stack-related problems from the NeetCode 150 list.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open it in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pratyush021/DSA-Practice.git
cd DSA-Practice
